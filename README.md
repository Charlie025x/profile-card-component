## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Getting the card's images to overlap the way I wanted them to was difficult. In the end I made the blue texture a background image of the grid cell and I positioned profile picture using "position: relative".

```css
.profilePic {
    position: relative;
}
```
I'm still having trouble with the background svg.

### Continued development

I need to work on posistion SVGs
